# dessert-finder

Dessert-Finder is meant to help people search for a dessert based on culture, popularity, and allergies. 

Currently, a RESTful API has been created with Flask. The plan forward is to use React.js to access the API and create a suitable UI design.
Further plans involve using an external API to find places that may serve the desired dessert.
